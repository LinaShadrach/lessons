## Epicodus Lessons

_Curriculum written by Lina Shadrach_

This repo contains lessons written for [Epicodus](www.epicodus.com), a vocational web development school located in Portland, Or. While I have contributed to updating the majority of the preexisting curriculum, I wrote these lessons from scratch.

The Epicodus curriculum is offered [free online](www.learnhowtoprogram.com).

Special thanks to Courtney Phillips, the lead curriculum developer at Epicodus, who proofreads and provides insightful feedback for my work.
